# Progdyn+, modified version of Progdyn
## Introduction
Quasi classical trajectory molecular dynamic (QCT-MD) simulation is a powerful tool for studying bifurcated potential energy surface problems. Progdyn (https://github.com/DanielSingleton/Progdyn), the program used to run QCT-MD develpoed by Daniel Singleton, however, is not easy to use and its features are limited. 

Progdyn+ is the modified and repackaged Progdyn version. Not only has the computational efficiency and ease of use been greatly improved, but many features have been added that were not available in the original version, such as support for the ONIOM system and frozen atoms.
